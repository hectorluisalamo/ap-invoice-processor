## 💡 Executive Summary & ROI Value Proposition

Manual Accounts Payable (AP) processing is an enterprise bottleneck. Independent benchmarks put the fully-loaded cost of processing a single invoice manually at **$10–$40**: APQC's 2024–2025 Open Standards data reports a **$21.40 median** (and **$10.18** for top-quartile organizations)[^apqc], while Ardent Partners' *AP Metrics That Matter (2025)* cites **$15–$40 for primarily-manual workflows** and a **$12.88 average** across non-best-in-class teams[^ardent]. This model uses a conservative mid-range **$14.50** manual baseline. 

**AP Copilot** is an autonomous accounts-payable agent built on **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK 2.3.0)** that automates invoice extraction, GL account coding, and ERP posting through a local **NetSuite MCP server**—with a **hard Human-in-the-Loop safety gate** on high-dollar or risky invoices. (All data is 100% synthetic; the NetSuite target is a mock ERP behind a real MCP interface.)

### 📈 Benchmark Performance & ROI Highlights (N=50 Synthetic Invoices)
* **Autonomous Auto-Post Rate:** **44.0%** of routine invoices posted instantly with zero human intervention.
* **GL Coding Accuracy:** **82.0%** correct GL account assignment across the synthetic invoice set.
* **Safety Routing Accuracy:** **94.0%** of risky invoices correctly routed to a human reviewer.
* **Blended Cost per Invoice:** Reduced from **$14.50** (manual baseline) to **$1.75** (blended compute + triage cost).
* **Net Cost Reduction:** **87.9% Total Cost Savings**.

> **ROI methodology & assumptions (read this before quoting the number).** The blended cost is **computed, not hardcoded** — it is driven by the *measured* auto-post rate from the N=50 eval run (`eval/eval_harness.py`), so it moves with the agent's actual performance. The formula is a standard blended cost-per-invoice:
>
> ```
> blended = auto_post_rate × compute_cost + (1 − auto_post_rate) × (compute_cost + human_triage_cost)
> savings% = (manual_cost − blended) / manual_cost
> ```
>
> **Measured input:** `auto_post_rate = 44.0%` (share of the 50 synthetic invoices that cleared autonomously vs. routed to the human gate).
> **Stated modeling assumptions** (unit costs; swap them for your own to re-scope the ROI):
> | Parameter | Value | Basis |
> |---|---|---|
> | `manual_cost` | **$14.50 / invoice** | Conservative mid-range of the APQC / Ardent benchmarks cited above. |
> | `compute_cost` | **$0.35 / invoice** | Estimated agent compute per invoice (the agent itself makes no live LLM/API calls — see the keyless note). |
> | `human_triage_cost` | **$2.50 / invoice** | Estimated cost of a human reviewing one flagged invoice at the safety gate. |
>
> Worked: `0.44 × $0.35 + 0.56 × ($0.35 + $2.50) = $1.75`; savings `= ($14.50 − $1.75) / $14.50 = 87.9%`. The `compute_cost` and `human_triage_cost` figures are internal estimates, not benchmarked — they are exposed as constants at the top of the ROI block in `eval/eval_harness.py` so the model is fully transparent and adjustable.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

AP Copilot is structured as a branched 6-node ADK 2.3.0 `Workflow` graph—linear through extraction and validation, then forking at the Policy-Validator into an `auto_post` path or a `human_review` path—threading shared state (`InvoiceState`) and decision audit logs across every execution step:

```
┌──────────┐     ┌───────────┐     ┌──────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐
│  Intake  │ ──> │ Extractor │ ──> │ GL-Coder │ ──> │ Policy-Validator │
└──────────┘     └───────────┘     └──────────┘     └──────────────────┘
                                                             │
                                      ┌──────────────────────┴──────────────────────┐
                                      ▼ (auto_post)                                 ▼ (human_review)
                                ┌──────────┐                                ┌────────────┐
                                │  Poster  │ <───────────────────────────── │ Human Gate │ (Approved)
                                └──────────┘                                └────────────┘
                            (posts via NetSuite MCP)                         (Safety Rail)
```

### 🧩 Node Breakdown

| Node | Responsibilities | Shared State Transition |
|---|---|---|
| **Intake** | Ingests raw invoice payloads (JSON/text/scans) and initializes normalized shared state. | `raw invoice` → `normalized state` |
| **Extractor** | Reads the structured fields (vendor, total amount, date, line items, PO#) from the synthetic invoice payload and surfaces a per-field confidence score for each. | `invoice doc` → `structured fields + confidence` |
| **GL-Coder** | Maps line items to GL accounts and department codes using rules loaded from portable `SKILL.md`. | `line items` → `GL-coded entries` |
| **Policy-Validator** | Evaluates compliance: duplicate checks, PO database verification, unknown-vendor detection, low confidence (<0.85), and the **$5,000 auto-post ceiling** (≥ $5,000 routes to a human). | `coded entry` → `auto_post` vs `human_review` |
| **Human Gate** | Intercepts flagged entries via ADK `RequestInput` for interactive human triage (Approve/Reject). | `flagged entry` → `approved / rejected` |
| **Poster** | Posts approved entries through a local **NetSuite MCP server** (`mcp_server/`)—a mock NetSuite ERP exposed over a real MCP interface—and records the returned transaction ID (`NS-POST-XXXXX`). | `approved entry` → `posted GL entry` |

## 🎯 Competition Concepts Demonstrated (5 of 6 Named Concepts)

Four are implemented directly in code — the ADK graph, the MCP server, the Agent Skill, and the Security/HITL rails — plus Google Antigravity as the build surface: **5 of the 6** named concepts. Only Deployability is not claimed.

1. **ADK 2.3.0 Workflow Multi-Agent Graph:** Built natively using `google.adk.workflow.Workflow`, `@node` decorators, and explicit conditional routing (`Edge(from_node=..., to_node=..., route=...)`).
2. **MCP Server:** A local **NetSuite MCP server** and client (`mcp_server/`)—the Poster node posts approved entries through the real MCP interface to a mock NetSuite ERP.
3. **Agent Skill (`SKILL.md`):** Portable skill definition in `skills/ap_invoice_skill/SKILL.md` encapsulating GL mapping tables, keyword fallbacks, and policy thresholds, parsed dynamically at runtime.
4. **Security & Human-in-the-Loop Safety Rails:** Hard **$5,000 auto-post dollar ceiling**, duplicate invoice prevention, and interactive `RequestInput` human gate.
5. **Google Antigravity:** Used as the primary build surface; the round-by-round build artifacts are preserved under [`docs/`](docs/AUDIT.md).

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
* Python **3.11+**
* Virtual Environment manager (`uv` or standard `venv`)

### Setup Commands
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hectorluisalamo/ap-invoice-processor.git
cd ap-invoice-processor

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install pinned dependencies (includes the `mcp` package)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **No API key required.** The demo runs entirely on 100% synthetic data and makes no live LLM calls—the Extractor consumes pre-structured synthetic fields, so there is nothing to authenticate. Just install and run.

## 🚀 How to Run the Demo & Evaluation

### 1. Launch the Live Web Dashboard UI
Experience the interactive visual dashboard featuring real-time node pipeline state animations, human-in-the-loop triage intervention desk, and audit logs:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
PYTHONPATH=. uvicorn web.server:web_app --reload --port 8000
```
👉 Open your browser to **`http://localhost:8000`**

Run any of the bundled synthetic scenarios, or use the **Test Your Own Invoice** panel to submit a custom vendor/amount/PO/line-item and watch it run through the same graph (`POST /api/run-custom`). Inputs above the $5,000 ceiling, with an unknown vendor, or with a bad/missing PO route to the Human Gate—exactly like the pre-baked cases.

### 2. Run the Interactive CLI Demo
Run sample invoice scenarios directly in your console:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
PYTHONPATH=. python cli_demo.py
```

### 3. Run the Automated Evaluation Benchmark (N=50)
Execute the batch evaluation harness across 50 synthetic invoices to verify accuracy and generate the statistical ROI readout:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
PYTHONPATH=. python eval/eval_harness.py
```

### 4. Run Unit Tests
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/
```
